    Should I Use MySQLi or PDO?<br>
    Both MySQLi and PDO have their advantages:<br>
    PDO will work on 12 different database systems, whereas MySQLi will only work with MySQL databases.<br>
    Both are object-oriented, but MySQLi also offers a procedural API.<br>
    Both support Prepared Statements. Prepared Statements protect from SQL injection, 
    and are very important for web application security. </blockquote>
